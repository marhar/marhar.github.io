# Doom Scenarios: When Scenario 2 Is Worse Than Doing Nothing

This document catalogs historical scenarios where **Scenario 2 (Mortgage + Invest) performs worse than Scenario 3 (Pay Cash Only)**.

In these cases, you would have been better off simply paying cash for the home and making **zero investments** rather than trying to leverage with a mortgage.

- High inflation, stagnant markets
- S2 worse by $1.4 million

### 2000-2001: Dot-com Crash

## Common Patterns

All doom scenarios share these characteristics:

1. **Bad Market Timing**
   - Starting right before a major crash
   - Great Depression (1929)
   - Stagflation (1973)
   - Dot-com bubble (2000)
   - Financial crisis (2007)

2. **High Mortgage Rates**
   - 6% or higher
   - Interest costs compound the problem
   - Makes recovery from market crashes much harder

3. **Multiple Crashes**
   - Longer terms (30 years) expose you to multiple downturns
   - 2001 start: dot-com crash (2001-2002) + financial crisis (2008)
   - 1929 start: Great Depression for years

4. **Investment Depletion**
   - All scenarios show investment going to zero
   - Additional payments needed after depletion
   - Interest costs continue regardless of market performance

- Additional payments needed: $343,018
- Investment depletes at month 99

### Maximum Doom Test
```
Home Price: $500,000
Mortgage Rate: 10%
Term: 30 years
Starting Year: 1929
```

**Expected:**
- Scenario 2: -$5,481,050
- Scenario 3: $500,000 (green winner card)
- Catastrophic loss

## Key Takeaway

**Scenario 3 (Pay Cash Only) is the floor.**

No matter how bad the market gets:
- You always own the home ($500,000)
- You never owe interest
- You can never be forced to make additional payments

In doom scenarios, even this "do nothing" baseline beats the leveraged investment strategy.

This demonstrates the extreme risk of Scenario 2: it's not just about lower returnsâ€”it can result in **catastrophic losses** that make you worse off than if you had never invested at all.
