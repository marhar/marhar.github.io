> we want to create a geo web app.  on a map, allow the user to
click on locations.  Each click, we save the location and show a
pointer on the map. in addition, we calculate the center of the
clicked locations, and show that, with lines coming from each
location to the center.

> add a display of the lat/long of each coordinate

> make an option to switch to a globe

> add a search box for locations. provide a list of found locations,
and allow the user to select one. place a pin and treat it as above.

> add two features: drag and drop a point, and delete a point

> when i drag, update the center and lines dynamically

> add the delete functionality to the popup also

> examine everything. think very hard, refactor, beautify, and
improve code and docs as necessary
