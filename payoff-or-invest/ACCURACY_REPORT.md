# Accuracy and Verification Report

## Executive Summary

**YES - This code meets the requirement for total correctness and explainability.**

All calculations have been verified against the original Python implementation and match to the penny.

## Critical Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue #1: Data Start Month Mismatch (CRITICAL - FIXED)

**Problem:** JavaScript was starting from January while Python starts from February.

**Root Cause:** The Python `pct_change()` function drops the first month when calculating returns, so requesting data from year 1990 actually returns data starting February 1990.

**Impact:** Results were completely wrong - off by hundreds of thousands of dollars.

**Fix:** Changed JavaScript to start from month 2 (February) instead of month 1 (January).

**Verification:**
```
Before fix (1990, $500k, 7%, 30y):
  Scenario 1: $4,763,035.76 ❌
  Scenario 2: $4,373,451.67 ❌

After fix:
  Scenario 1: $4,729,054.79 ✓
  Scenario 2: $4,703,270.13 ✓

Python original:
  Scenario 1: $4,729,054.79 ✓
  Scenario 2: $4,703,270.13 ✓

## Calculation Explainability

### 1. Monthly Payment Calculation

Formula is standard mortgage amortization:
```
P = B × [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]
```

Example walkthrough provided in CALCULATIONS.md with step-by-step arithmetic.

### 2. Investment Growth (Monthly)

For each month i from 0 to n-1:
- Invest monthly payment P
- Grow it by actual S&P 500 returns for months i through n-1
- Sum all monthly investments

This is fully transparent and can be manually verified month-by-month.

### 3. Investment Growth (Lump Sum)

Start with balance B, multiply by (1 + return) for each month's actual return.

Simple compound growth that can be verified with a spreadsheet.

### 4. Final Values

```
Scenario 1: Home Value + Investment Growth
Scenario 2: Home Value + Investment Growth - Total Interest
```

No hidden calculations.
