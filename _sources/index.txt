   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Mark's Library of Good Things
=============================

This is my Programmer's Notebook.  I've collected various bits
of wisdom on my blog, in Google docs, Stack Overflow, local
fileage, etc.  It's pretty random,
but it will mostly be about computers and programming.  Since
I generally take lots of notes when I'm learning something, you can
consider it an ongoing journal of my ignorance!

This incarnation is a sphinx document hosted on Github Pages.
Is that the right way to do things?  Ping me if you know something
better!
