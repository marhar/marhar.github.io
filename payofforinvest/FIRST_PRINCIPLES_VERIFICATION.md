## Verification Method 1: Mathematical Formula Derivation

### Mortgage Payment Formula

**Derived from present value of annuity:**

```
Present Value = Payment × [(1 - (1+r)^-n) / r]

Solving for Payment:
Payment = PV × [r / (1 - (1+r)^-n)]
        = PV × [r × (1+r)^n / ((1+r)^n - 1)]
```

**Manual Calculation for $500,000 at 7% for 30 years:**

```
Principal (PV) = $500,000
Monthly rate (r) = 0.07 / 12 = 0.005833333...
Number of payments (n) = 360

(1 + r)^n = 1.005833333^360 = 8.116497475

Payment = $500,000 × [0.005833333 × 8.116497475 / (8.116497475 - 1)]
        = $500,000 × [0.047346235 / 7.116497475]
        = $500,000 × 0.006653025
        = $3,326.51 ✓
```

**Cross-check:** Bankrate.com mortgage calculator for same parameters: $3,326.51 ✓

**Total Interest:**
```
Total Paid = $3,326.51 × 360 = $1,197,544.49
Total Interest = $1,197,544.49 - $500,000 = $697,544.49 ✓
```

## Verification Method 3: Step-by-Step Calculation Examples

### Example: Monthly Investment Compounding

**Scenario:** Invest $100/month for 3 months with returns of +10%, -5%, +20%

**Month 0 Investment:**
```
Invest $100
  After month 1 (+10%): $100 × 1.10 = $110.00
  After month 2 (-5%):  $110 × 0.95 = $104.50
  After month 3 (+20%): $104.50 × 1.20 = $125.40
```

**Month 1 Investment:**
```
Invest $100
  After month 2 (-5%):  $100 × 0.95 = $95.00
  After month 3 (+20%): $95 × 1.20 = $114.00
```

**Month 2 Investment:**
```
Invest $100
  After month 3 (+20%): $100 × 1.20 = $120.00
```

**Total:** $125.40 + $114.00 + $120.00 = $359.40 ✓

### Example: Lump Sum Compounding

**Scenario:** Invest $300 lump sum with same returns

```
Initial: $300.00
After month 1 (+10%): $300 × 1.10 = $330.00
After month 2 (-5%):  $330 × 0.95 = $313.50
After month 3 (+20%): $313.50 × 1.20 = $376.20 ✓
```

**Manual:** $300 × 1.10 × 0.95 × 1.20 = $376.20 ✓

## Verification Method 4: Independent Implementation

Created completely new implementation from scratch with no code reuse:

### Test Case: $500k, 7%, 30 years, starting 1990

| Metric | Independent Calculation | Expected | Match |
|--------|------------------------|----------|-------|
| Monthly Payment | $3,326.51 | $3,326.51 | ✓ |
| Total Interest | $697,544.49 | $697,544.49 | ✓ |
| Scenario 1 Investment | $4,229,054.79 | $4,229,054.79 | ✓ |
| Scenario 1 Total | $4,729,054.79 | $4,729,054.79 | ✓ |
| Scenario 2 Investment | $4,900,814.62 | $4,900,814.62 | ✓ |
| Scenario 2 Total | $4,703,270.13 | $4,703,270.13 | ✓ |
| Difference | $25,784.66 | $25,784.66 | ✓ |

**All values match exactly.**

## Verification Method 5: Python vs JavaScript Comparison

Verified JavaScript implementation against Python:

```bash
# Run Python
python3 buyhouse.py 1990 -b 500000 -r 0.07 -t 30

# Run JavaScript test
open test_javascript.html

# Results: IDENTICAL ✓
```

Both produce:
- Scenario 1: $4,729,054.79
- Scenario 2: $4,703,270.13
- Difference: $25,784.66 (Scenario 1 wins)

### 2. Compound Returns

**Formula:**
```
Final Value = Initial × (1 + r₁) × (1 + r₂) × ... × (1 + rₙ)
```

**Source:** Basic compound interest, fundamental to finance.

**Validation:** Standard formula, no controversy.

### 3. Dollar Cost Averaging

## Critical Findings

### ✅ What's Correct

1. **Mortgage calculations:** Perfect match with industry calculators
2. **S&P 500 data:** Authentic Yahoo Finance data, verified fresh download
3. **Compounding logic:** Correct implementation of compound returns
4. **Both scenarios:** Properly account for all costs and growth
5. **Python and JavaScript:** Produce identical results

### ⚠️ Important Caveats (Properly Documented)

2. **No taxes** - Capital gains, mortgage interest deduction not included
3. **No fees** - Transaction costs, fund expense ratios not included
4. **No home appreciation** - Assumes home maintains value
5. **No inflation** - All values in nominal terms

All caveats are clearly documented in the UI and documentation.
